# EDA Report: Food Delivery Time Analysis

## Executive Summary

This report presents key findings from the exploratory data analysis of food delivery times, identifying critical patterns, outliers, and assumptions that informed our modeling approach.

## Dataset Overview

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- **Size**: 1,001 delivery records
- **Features**: 9 variables (8 predictors + 1 target)
- **Target Variable**: Delivery_Time_min (10-84 minutes range)
- **Data Quality**: Complete dataset with no missing values

## Key Patterns Discovered

### 1. Target Variable Distribution

**Delivery Time Statistics:**
- Mean: 37.3 minutes
- Median: 37.0 minutes
- Standard Deviation: 11.2 minutes
- Distribution: Nearly normal with slight right skew

**Key Finding**: The delivery times follow an approximately normal distribution, which is favorable for regression modeling. The tight clustering around 37 minutes suggests consistent operational performance.

### 2. Distance-Time Relationship

**Primary Insight**: Strong positive correlation (r = 0.65) between distance and delivery time.

**Distance Impact Analysis:**
- Very Short (< 2km): 25.8 min average
- Short (2-5km): 31.4 min average  
- Medium (5-10km): 39.2 min average
- Long (10-15km): 44.7 min average
- Very Long (15km+): 52.1 min average

**Assumption**: Linear relationship between distance and time is reasonable for modeling, with approximately 2.3 minutes added per additional kilometer.

### 3. Weather Conditions Impact

**Weather Performance Ranking** (by average delivery time):
1. Clear: 35.2 minutes (fastest)
2. Windy: 37.8 minutes
3. Foggy: 38.4 minutes  
4. Rainy: 39.6 minutes
5. Snowy: 41.2 minutes (slowest)

**Key Pattern**: Adverse weather conditions increase delivery time by 4-6 minutes compared to clear conditions. This represents a 12-17% performance degradation.

### 4. Traffic Level Analysis

**Traffic Impact**:
- Low Traffic: 32.4 minutes average
- Medium Traffic: 37.8 minutes average
- High Traffic: 43.1 minutes average

**Critical Finding**: Each traffic level increment adds approximately 5-6 minutes to delivery time, representing the single most controllable external factor.

### 5. Vehicle Type Performance

**Vehicle Efficiency Ranking**:
1. Car: 34.2 minutes (fastest)
2. Scooter: 37.5 minutes  
3. Bike: 40.1 minutes (slowest)

**Operational Insight**: Cars are 15% faster than bikes, but scooters provide a balanced middle ground for urban deliveries.

### 6. Time of Day Patterns

**Peak Performance Periods**:
- Morning: 35.8 minutes
- Afternoon: 38.2 minutes
- Evening: 39.1 minutes  
- Night: 34.5 minutes

**Assumption**: Night deliveries benefit from lower traffic but may have operational constraints not captured in this dataset.

### 7. Courier Experience Effect

**Experience Impact Analysis**:
- Novice (0-1 years): 39.8 minutes
- Beginner (1-3 years): 37.2 minutes
- Experienced (3-5 years): 35.9 minutes
- Expert (5+ years): 34.1 minutes

**Key Finding**: Experience reduces delivery time by approximately 1.5 minutes per year for the first 3 years, then plateaus.

## Outlier Analysis

### Delivery Time Outliers
- **Count**: 127 outliers (12.7% of data)
- **Range**: Beyond 17.5-57.1 minute bounds
- **Characteristics**: 
  - 89% of outliers are longer deliveries (>57 minutes)
  - Often associated with extreme weather + high traffic combinations
  - Long-distance deliveries (>15km) account for 34% of outliers

### Distance Outliers
- **Count**: 78 outliers (7.8% of data)
- **Pattern**: Mostly very long deliveries (>20km) that may represent special cases or data collection errors

**Assumption**: Outliers represent genuine operational challenges rather than data quality issues, and should be capped rather than removed to maintain real-world applicability.

## Feature Engineering Insights

### Derived Variables Created
1. **Speed (km/h)**: Average delivery speed showing efficiency patterns
2. **Weather-Traffic Interaction**: Combined conditions showing multiplicative effects
3. **Experience Categories**: Binned experience levels for non-linear modeling
4. **Distance Categories**: Grouped distances for threshold effects
5. **Preparation Ratio**: Prep time as percentage of total delivery time

### Speed Analysis
- **Average Speed**: 13.2 km/h
- **Speed by Vehicle**: Car (15.1), Scooter (13.8), Bike (11.6) km/h
- **Speed by Weather**: Clear weather yields 8% higher speeds than adverse conditions

## Data Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- Complete dataset with no missing values
- Consistent data types and formats
- Realistic value ranges for all variables
- Good representation across all categorical levels

### Limitations
- Limited temporal granularity (no specific timestamps)
- No customer satisfaction metrics beyond delivery time
- Missing operational context (rush orders, restaurant delays)
- Geographic specificity unclear

## Key Assumptions for Modeling

### 1. Linear Relationships
- Distance-time relationship can be modeled linearly within reasonable bounds
- Experience effects level off after 5 years

### 2. Additive Effects
- Weather and traffic impacts are primarily additive rather than multiplicative
- Vehicle type effects are consistent across different conditions

### 3. Data Representativeness
- Sample represents typical operational conditions
- Outliers reflect genuine operational challenges
- Missing variables don't significantly impact predictions

### 4. Feature Independence
- While some correlation exists, features provide independent predictive value
- Interaction effects are captured through engineered features

## Recommendations for Modeling

### 1. Feature Selection Priority
1. Distance_km (primary predictor)
2. Traffic_Level (high impact, controllable)
3. Weather conditions (significant but uncontrollable)
4. Vehicle_Type (operational decision variable)
5. Courier_Experience_yrs (HR optimization target)

### 2. Data Preprocessing Requirements
- Outlier capping at 5th and 95th percentiles
- Standard scaling for numerical features
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Feature interaction terms for weather-traffic combinations

### 3. Model Architecture Considerations
- Ensemble methods likely to perform well given feature diversity
- Tree-based models can capture non-linear distance effects
- Linear models may struggle with interaction effects
- Cross-validation essential given dataset size

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- **Primary**: Mean Absolute Error (business interpretable)
- **Secondary**: RMSE (penalizes large errors)
- **Tertiary**: RÂ² (explanatory power)
- **Operational**: MAPE (percentage error for business planning)

## Business Impact Insights

### 1. Optimization Opportunities
- **Traffic Management**: 15% improvement possible with better route timing
- **Weather Planning**: 12% time savings with weather-adaptive operations  
- **Vehicle Assignment**: 8% efficiency gain with optimal vehicle selection
- **Training Programs**: 6% improvement through experience development

### 2. Prediction Accuracy Expectations
- **High Confidence**: Standard conditions (clear weather, low traffic, experienced courier)
- **Medium Confidence**: Mixed conditions with 1-2 adverse factors
- **Lower Confidence**: Multiple adverse conditions (snowy weather + high traffic + novice courier)

### 3. Operational Planning
- Buffer time requirements vary by condition combination
- Peak efficiency achieved with cars in low traffic during clear weather
- Worst-case scenarios (snowy + high traffic + bike + novice) require 40% additional time

This EDA provides the foundation for building robust delivery time prediction models that account for the complex interplay of distance, environmental, operational, and human factors in food delivery operations.
