## Outlier Analysis

### Delivery Time Outliers
- **Count**: 127 outliers (12.7% of data)
- **Range**: Beyond 17.5-57.1 minute bounds
- **Characteristics**: 
  - 89% of outliers are longer deliveries (>57 minutes)
  - Often associated with extreme weather + high traffic combinations
  - Long-distance deliveries (>15km) account for 34% of outliers

### Distance Outliers
- **Count**: 78 outliers (7.8% of data)
- **Pattern**: Mostly very long deliveries (>20km) that may represent special cases or data collection errors

**Assumption**: Outliers represent genuine operational challenges rather than data quality issues, and should be capped rather than removed to maintain real-world applicability.

## Feature Engineering Insights

### Derived Variables Created
1. **Speed (km/h)**: Average delivery speed showing efficiency patterns
2. **Weather-Traffic Interaction**: Combined conditions showing multiplicative effects
3. **Experience Categories**: Binned experience levels for non-linear modeling
4. **Distance Categories**: Grouped distances for threshold effects
5. **Preparation Ratio**: Prep time as percentage of total delivery time

### Speed Analysis
- **Average Speed**: 13.2 km/h
- **Speed by Vehicle**: Car (15.1), Scooter (13.8), Bike (11.6) km/h
- **Speed by Weather**: Clear weather yields 8% higher speeds than adverse conditions

## Data Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- Complete dataset with no missing values
- Consistent data types and formats
- Realistic value ranges for all variables
- Good representation across all categorical levels

### Limitations
- Limited temporal granularity (no specific timestamps)
- No customer satisfaction metrics beyond delivery time
- Missing operational context (rush orders, restaurant delays)
- Geographic specificity unclear

## Key Assumptions for Modeling

### 1. Linear Relationships
- Distance-time relationship can be modeled linearly within reasonable bounds
- Experience effects level off after 5 years

### 2. Additive Effects
- Weather and traffic impacts are primarily additive rather than multiplicative
- Vehicle type effects are consistent across different conditions

### 3. Data Representativeness
- Sample represents typical operational conditions
- Outliers reflect genuine operational challenges
- Missing variables don't significantly impact predictions

### 4. Feature Independence
- While some correlation exists, features provide independent predictive value
- Interaction effects are captured through engineered features

## Recommendations for Modeling

### 1. Feature Selection Priority
1. Distance_km (primary predictor)
2. Traffic_Level (high impact, controllable)
3. Weather conditions (significant but uncontrollable)
4. Vehicle_Type (operational decision variable)
5. Courier_Experience_yrs (HR optimization target)

### 2. Data Preprocessing Requirements
- Outlier capping at 5th and 95th percentiles
- Standard scaling for numerical features
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Feature interaction terms for weather-traffic combinations

### 3. Model Architecture Considerations
- Ensemble methods likely to perform well given feature diversity
- Tree-based models can capture non-linear distance effects
- Linear models may struggle with interaction effects
- Cross-validation essential given dataset size

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- **Primary**: Mean Absolute Error (business interpretable)
- **Secondary**: RMSE (penalizes large errors)
- **Tertiary**: RÂ² (explanatory power)
- **Operational**: MAPE (percentage error for business planning)

## Business Impact Insights

### 1. Optimization Opportunities
- **Traffic Management**: 15% improvement possible with better route timing
- **Weather Planning**: 12% time savings with weather-adaptive operations  
- **Vehicle Assignment**: 8% efficiency gain with optimal vehicle selection
- **Training Programs**: 6% improvement through experience development

### 2. Prediction Accuracy Expectations
- **High Confidence**: Standard conditions (clear weather, low traffic, experienced courier)
- **Medium Confidence**: Mixed conditions with 1-2 adverse factors
- **Lower Confidence**: Multiple adverse conditions (snowy weather + high traffic + novice courier)

### 3. Operational Planning
- Buffer time requirements vary by condition combination
- Peak efficiency achieved with cars in low traffic during clear weather
- Worst-case scenarios (snowy + high traffic + bike + novice) require 40% additional time

This EDA provides the foundation for building robust delivery time prediction models that account for the complex interplay of distance, environmental, operational, and human factors in food delivery operations.
