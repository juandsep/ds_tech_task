## Outlier Analysis

![Outlier Distribution](images/outliers_boxplot.png)
*Figure 9: Distribution of delivery time outliers showing extreme cases*

### Delivery Time Outliers
- **Count**: 127 outliers (12.7% of data)
- **Range**: Beyond 17.5-57.1 minute bounds
- **Characteristics**: 
  - 89% of outliers are longer deliveries (>57 minutes)
  - Often associated with extreme weather + high traffic combinations
  - Long-distance deliveries (>15km) account for 34% of outliers

### Distance Outliers
- **Count**: 78 outliers (7.8% of data)
- **Pattern**: Mostly very long deliveries (>20km) that may represent special cases or data collection errors

**Assumption**: Outliers represent genuine operational challenges rather than data quality issues, and should be capped rather than removed to maintain real-world applicability.
