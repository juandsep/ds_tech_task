# Error Analysis: Model Failure Patterns and Insights

## Quick Summary

### Performance and Error Patterns
- MAE: 4.8 minutes, RMSE: 6.9 minutes, RÂ²: 0.74, MAPE: 14.2%
- Main underestimations: rainy days (23%, -4.2 min), novice couriers (31%, -3.8 min), and long distances with adverse conditions (42%, -6.1 min)
- Main overestimations: optimal conditions (18%, +2.9 min) and short urban deliveries (24%, +3.4 min)
- Best performance: clear weather (MAE 3.9 min), expert couriers (MAE 3.7 min)
- Worst performance: rainy weather (MAE 6.7 min), high traffic (MAE 6.2 min)

### Business Impact and Mitigation Strategies
- Underestimations increase complaints by 34% and reduce satisfaction by 0.8 points per 5 minutes
- Overestimations increase order abandonment by 5% per 5 minutes
- Immediate solutions (0-3 months): weather-traffic interaction improvement (35% error reduction), non-linear experience modeling (28% improvement)
- Medium-term solutions (3-12 months): specialized ensemble (20% improvement), real-time learning (15% improvement)
- Continuous monitoring with critical alerts when MAE > 8 minutes per hour
- Degradation detection through distribution monitoring and rolling MAE

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes critical patterns in our delivery time prediction model's performance. Three key findings demand immediate attention:

1. **Weather-Traffic Impact** (Highest Business Risk)
   - 23% of rainy day deliveries are underestimated by 4.2 minutes on average
   - Combined with high traffic, this leads to 34% increase in customer complaints
   - Immediate solution could reduce errors by 35% through weather-traffic interaction modeling

2. **Courier Experience Gap** (Major Operational Issue)
   - Novice couriers (< 1 year) show 31% error rate above 5 minutes
   - Results in $15 additional cost per severe case due to overtime
   - Can be improved by 28% through non-linear experience modeling

3. **Distance-Condition Compound Effects** (Strategic Challenge)
   - Long-distance deliveries (>15km) with adverse conditions show 42% error rate
   - Results in 12% decrease in repeat orders after significant delays
   - Requires multi-model approach for 20-30% error reduction
