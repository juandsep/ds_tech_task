# Model Notes: Delivery Time Prediction

## Key Modeling Insights

This analysis summarizes the three most critical aspects of our delivery time prediction model development.

## 1. Algorithm Performance Hierarchy

Based on cross-validation results, model performance ranked as follows:
- **XGBoost**: Best performer (MAE: 4.8 min, R²: 0.74)
- **Random Forest**: Strong baseline (MAE: 5.2 min, R²: 0.71)
- **LightGBM**: Fast alternative (MAE: 5.0 min, R²: 0.72)
- **Ridge Regression**: Interpretable baseline (MAE: 6.1 min, R²: 0.65)
- **Linear Regression**: Simple baseline (MAE: 7.2 min, R²: 0.58)

### Model Selection Criteria
XGBoost was selected based on:
- **Lowest MAE**: 4.8 minutes vs 5.0+ for alternatives
- **Robust Performance**: Consistent across weather and traffic conditions
- **Feature Handling**: Superior interaction effect modeling
- **Production Ready**: Fast inference (<100ms) with reasonable memory footprint

### XGBoost Advantages vs Competitors
- **vs Random Forest**: 8% better MAE, handles feature interactions more effectively
- **vs LightGBM**: Slightly better accuracy, more stable hyperparameter tuning
- **vs Linear Models**: Captures non-linear patterns and complex interactions
- **vs SVR**: Faster training and inference, better interpretability

**Business Impact**: XGBoost selected for production with 13% average prediction error.

## 2. Feature Engineering Success

Key engineered features significantly improved model performance:
- **Speed Calculation**: Enhanced distance-time relationship modeling
- **Weather-Traffic Interactions**: Captured compound effects of adverse conditions
- **Experience Categories**: Non-linear courier performance patterns
