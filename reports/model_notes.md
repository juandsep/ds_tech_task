# Model Notes: Delivery Time Prediction

## Executive Summary

This document outlines our modeling approach for delivery time prediction, including algorithm selection, hyperparameter tuning methodology, and evaluation metrics rationale.

## Modeling Logic & Strategy

### Problem Formulation
- **Type**: Regression problem (continuous target variable)
- **Target**: Delivery_Time_min (10-84 minutes range)
- **Business Goal**: Accurate time estimates for customer expectations and operational planning
- **Success Criteria**: MAE < 5 minutes, R² > 0.7, robust performance across conditions

### Model Selection Rationale

We implemented a multi-algorithm approach to identify the best performer:

#### 1. Linear Models
- **Linear Regression**: Baseline for interpretability
- **Ridge Regression**: Handle multicollinearity with L2 regularization
- **Lasso Regression**: Feature selection with L1 regularization

**Rationale**: Strong distance-time correlation suggests linear models may perform well. Good for interpretability and fast inference.

#### 2. Tree-Based Models
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method handling non-linearities
- **Gradient Boosting**: Sequential learning for complex patterns
- **XGBoost**: Optimized gradient boosting with regularization
- **LightGBM**: Efficient boosting for faster training

**Rationale**: EDA revealed interaction effects (weather-traffic, vehicle-experience) that tree-based models handle naturally.

#### 3. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- **RBF Kernel**: Capture non-linear relationships
- **Regularization**: Control overfitting

**Rationale**: Potential for complex decision boundaries while maintaining generalization.

### Feature Engineering Strategy

#### Primary Features (Direct EDA Insights)
```python
numerical_features = ['Distance_km', 'Preparation_Time_min', 'Courier_Experience_yrs']
categorical_features = ['Weather', 'Traffic_Level', 'Time_of_Day', 'Vehicle_Type']
```

#### Engineered Features
1. **Speed Calculation**: `Speed_kmh = (Distance_km / Delivery_Time_min) * 60`
2. **Experience Categories**: Binned experience levels (Novice, Beginner, Experienced, Expert)
3. **Distance Categories**: Grouped distances for threshold effects
4. **Weather-Traffic Interaction**: Combined adverse conditions
5. **Preparation Ratio**: Prep time as percentage of total delivery time

#### Feature Transformation Pipeline
```python
# Numerical: StandardScaler for normal distribution
# Categorical: OneHotEncoder with drop='first' to avoid multicollinearity
# Missing Values: Median for numerical, Mode for categorical
# Outliers: IQR-based capping at 5th/95th percentiles
```

## Metric Choice & Justification

### Primary Metrics

#### 1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) - PRIMARY
- **Business Interpretation**: Average minutes of prediction error
- **Robustness**: Less sensitive to outliers than RMSE
- **Customer Impact**: Direct measure of customer expectation accuracy
- **Target**: < 5 minutes (< 13% of average delivery time)

#### 2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) - SECONDARY
- **Large Error Penalty**: Penalizes significant mispredictions
- **Model Comparison**: Standard regression metric
- **Operational Impact**: Highlights worst-case scenarios
- **Target**: < 7 minutes

#### 3. R-squared (R²) - EXPLANATORY
- **Variance Explained**: Model's explanatory power
- **Baseline Comparison**: Improvement over mean prediction
- **Target**: > 0.7 (70% variance explained)

#### 4. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) - BUSINESS
- **Percentage Terms**: Business-friendly metric
- **Scale Independence**: Comparable across different datasets
- **Target**: < 15%

### Cross-Validation Strategy
- **Method**: 5-fold cross-validation
- **Rationale**: Balance between computational cost and robust estimation
- **Stratification**: Not applicable for regression, but ensured balanced splits
- **Randomization**: Fixed random_state=42 for reproducibility

## Hyperparameter Tuning Approach

### Search Strategy
- **Method**: GridSearchCV for comprehensive search
- **Alternative**: RandomizedSearchCV for large parameter spaces
- **Optimization**: neg_mean_absolute_error (minimize MAE)

### Model-Specific Tuning

#### Random Forest
```python
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'max_depth': [5, 10, 15, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4]
}
```
**Focus**: Balance between model complexity and overfitting

#### XGBoost
```python
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'max_depth': [3, 6, 9],
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1, 0.2],
    'subsample': [0.8, 0.9, 1.0]
}
```
**Focus**: Learning rate optimization and regularization

#### Ridge/Lasso
```python
param_grid = {
    'alpha': [0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]
}
```
**Focus**: Regularization strength for optimal bias-variance trade-off

### Validation Strategy
- **Training Set**: 80% of data for model fitting
- **Test Set**: 20% held-out for final evaluation
