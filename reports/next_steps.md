# Next Steps: Project Improvements

## Key Enhancement Opportunities
## 1. Geospatial Data Integration

- **Real-time Traffic APIs**: Integration with Google Maps/Waze for dynamic traffic conditions
- **Neighborhood Demographics**: Local area characteristics, business density, infrastructure quality
- **Route Optimization**: Actual driving routes instead of straight-line distance calculations
- **Geographic Clustering**: Zone-specific model variants based on delivery patterns

## 2. Multi-Modal Data Sources

- **Restaurant Metrics**: Kitchen efficiency, order complexity, staff levels
- **Hyperlocal Weather**: Detailed weather conditions, precipitation intensity, visibility
- **Event-Driven Factors**: Local events, holidays, school schedules affecting traffic
- **External Data**: Economic indicators, infrastructure conditions, seasonal patterns
