# Additional Business Insights and Analysis

Based on the food delivery database, here are 3 key business insights that provide actionable intelligence for optimizing delivery operations:

## 1. Peak Hours and Revenue Optimization
**Question**: When are the busiest delivery periods and highest revenue opportunities?

```sql
-- Peak hours analysis with revenue impact
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN CAST(strftime('%H', d.order_placed_at) AS INTEGER) BETWEEN 6 AND 11 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN CAST(strftime('%H', d.order_placed_at) AS INTEGER) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        WHEN CAST(strftime('%H', d.order_placed_at) AS INTEGER) BETWEEN 18 AND 23 THEN 'Evening'
        ELSE 'Night'
    END AS time_period,
    COUNT(*) AS delivery_count,
    AVG(d.delivery_time_min) AS avg_delivery_time,
    SUM(o.order_value) AS total_revenue,
    AVG(o.order_value) AS avg_order_value
FROM deliveries d
JOIN orders o ON d.delivery_id = o.delivery_id
GROUP BY time_period
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

## 2. Weather and Traffic Impact on Performance
**Question**: How do external conditions affect delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction?

```sql
-- Combined weather and traffic impact analysis
SELECT 
    d.weather_condition,
    d.traffic_condition,
    COUNT(*) AS delivery_count,
    AVG(d.delivery_time_min) AS avg_delivery_time,
    AVG(d.delivery_rating) AS avg_rating,
    ROUND(AVG(d.delivery_time_min) / AVG(d.delivery_distance_km), 2) AS efficiency_ratio
FROM deliveries d
GROUP BY d.weather_condition, d.traffic_condition
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10
ORDER BY avg_delivery_time DESC;
```

## 3. Delivery Person Performance and Training Needs
**Question**: Which delivery personnel need support and who are the top performers?

```sql
-- Delivery person performance categorization
SELECT 
    dp.name,
    dp.region,
    COUNT(d.delivery_id) AS total_deliveries,
    AVG(d.delivery_time_min) AS avg_delivery_time,
    AVG(d.delivery_rating) AS avg_rating,
    CASE 
        WHEN AVG(d.delivery_rating) >= 4.5 AND AVG(d.delivery_time_min) <= 35 THEN 'Top Performer'
        WHEN AVG(d.delivery_rating) >= 4.0 AND AVG(d.delivery_time_min) <= 45 THEN 'Good Performer'
        WHEN AVG(d.delivery_rating) >= 3.5 OR AVG(d.delivery_time_min) <= 55 THEN 'Average Performer'
        ELSE 'Needs Training'
    END AS performance_category
FROM delivery_persons dp
JOIN deliveries d ON dp.delivery_person_id = d.delivery_person_id
WHERE dp.is_active = 1
GROUP BY dp.delivery_person_id, dp.name, dp.region
HAVING COUNT(d.delivery_id) >= 20
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC, avg_delivery_time ASC;
```

## Business Recommendations

Based on these 3 key analyses, business teams can:

1. **Revenue Optimization**: Focus staffing and marketing during peak revenue periods (typically evening hours)
2. **Weather & Traffic Preparedness**: Develop contingency plans and adjust delivery expectations during adverse conditions
3. **Performance Management**: Implement targeted training programs for underperforming delivery personnel and recognition for top performers

Each query provides focused, actionable insights for immediate operational improvements.
